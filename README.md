This project is a complete e-commerce Progressive Web App built to learn the [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library.

## Technologies used

In addition to a deeper understanding of React, I learned:

1. [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing.
2. [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management.
3. [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), React Redux-lite.
4. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/):
   * Firebase authentication, including `GoogleAuthProvider` for signing in with Google
   * Firestore for data storage.
5. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for handling payments.
6. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server for handling Stripe payments on the backend.
7. [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) for styling the app with JS.
8. [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga), a popular library for handling Redux app side effects.
9. [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), for using state in functional components.
10. How to modify the app to make it a [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps).

## Future development and learning plans

1. Implement testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
2. Deep-dive [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo).
3. Deep-dive [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
4. Finish converting styles to use styled components.
5. Finish adding mobile styles.
